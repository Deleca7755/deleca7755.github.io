  Who?
  </h2> I'm Deleca7755 and that Is me →<br/>
  I'm a girl that roams around the Internet and makes myself look bad. I mostly do art, enjoy music and vidya games whilist having minimal motivation.
  <h2>
  What?
  </h2>This Is my "personal site", which contains things relevant to me that are also probably uninteresting.
  <h2>
Why?
  </h2>
      I want to share the things I like and my hobbies that people don't care about, where they can choose to care or not by simply going to this site. I tend to be Intrigued by others' lifestyles and such, and that Influenced my Idea to create It.</p></div>
