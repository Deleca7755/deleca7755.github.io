Apparently.</p>

<p class="aboutie">I was born on Decemember 11th, currently reside on planet Earth, and go by the name Deleca or sometimes Ladybird ( hence the site name, badylird ) on the Interwebs. I have an Insignificant life and happiness for a dream. My eyesight Is bad and probably gets worse by the day because my best friend In real life Is a laptop. I In fact do have and frequently wear the headphones shown In artwork. If you're attentive you'll notice how I capitalize words If they start with an 'I'. I know that Is super weird and It's because something I misheard/misremembered In school years ago stuck with me, so now I'm like this.<br><br>

I find myself having fun reading random posts on random forums, and brainstorm Ideas that will never happen, like this site, but look where I'm at now. Despite making this very basic site I don't tend to code or program or anything. But like most people I would consider It a nice skill to pick up on more. The most I do with my knowledge Is work on wikis, a hobby I'm passionate about. Along with learning more on programming I would love to get Into animation, as well as 3D modeling/animation and making music. When I make art I use a mouse and primary MS Paint or Aseprite. Any editing afterwards Is done In Photoshop.<br/><br/>

I am a very big fan of Pokemon. I also like other series such as Monster Hunter, Splatoon, Shantae, Touhou, Sims, Digimon and Persona. I own three 3DSes somehow and Installed custom firmware on two of them. I used to gen Pokemon for people, but never picked that back up despite wanting to, and I'm afraid the genning demand for 3DS games In particular has gone down, what with the Switch releases. In addition I own a Gameboy Color and a Gameboy Advance SP, a Switch, and previously owned a Wii U, Playstation 3, and Xbox 360. Derailing from gaming, I am a coffee enthusiast too, despite only ever drinking basic coffee and nothing fancy. But a girl can dream.<br/><br/>

I once had a sister and a mother but both have passed away years apart. But I'm still here, pressing on, making a site and finding a purpose. So far, the Idealism of "If nothing else the most I can/should do Is at least bring joy to other's lives" has worked out for me. With the support of a couple people here and there through rough times I'm still around, to do even more ridiculously stupid things here In this cyber space. To tell the tales that couldn't be told. To watch what life still has to unfold.</p>
