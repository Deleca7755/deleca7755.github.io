Apparently.<br><br>

I was born on Decemember 11th, currently reside on planet Earth, and go by the name Deleca, sometimes Ladybird, on the Interwebs. I have an Insignificant life and happiness for a dream. My eyesight Is bad and probably gets worse by the day because my best friend In real life Is a laptop. I In fact do have and frequently wear headphones and they aren't just for show; they keep my glasses on. I've adapted but I've always been an earphones person. If you're attentive you'll notice how I capitalize words If they start with an 'I'. I know that Is super weird and It's because something I misheard/misremembered In school years ago stuck with me, so now I'm like this.<br><br>

I frequent Reddit, find myself reading random posts on random forums, and brainstorm Ideas that will never happen, like this site, but look where I'm at now. Despite making this very basic site I don't tend to code or program or anything. But like most people I would consider It a nice skill to pick up on more. The most I do with my knowledge Is work on wikis, a hobby I'm passionate about. My aspirations Include figuring out what the heck my aspirations are. Along with learning more on the programming side I would love to get Into animation more, as well as 3D modeling/animation and music. Besides other random mundane things my reality really Is wiki editing and art-related activity, with that side of gaming, and maybe technical things <s>and being sad</s>.<br/><br/>

I am a very big fan of Pokemon. I like other series such as Monster Hunter, Splatoon, Shantae, Touhou, Sims, Digimon and Persona. I am a swagmaster who own three 3DSes somehow and also Installed CFW on two of them. I used to gen Pokemon for people, but never picked that back up despite wanting to, and I'm afraid the Pokegenning demand for 3DS games In particular has gone down, what with the Switch releases. But transferring Is still a thing, so maybe not? I have a few 3DS themes out there that I'd love to link here when I'm not feeling lazy. I also own a Gameboy Color and a Gameboy Advance SP, a Switch, and previously owned a Wii U, Playstation 3, and Xbox 360. Derailing from gaming, I'm a coffee enthusiast too, despite only ever drinking basic coffee and nothing fancy. But a girl can dream.<br/><br/>

I once had a sister and a mother but both have passed away years apart. But I'm still here, pressing on, making a site and finding a purpose. So far, the Idealism of "If nothing else the most I can/should do Is at least bring joy to other's lives" has worked out for me. With the support of a couple people here and there through rough times I'm still around, to do even more ridiculously stupid things here In this cyber space. To tell the tales that couldn't be told. To watch what life still has to unfold.</p>
