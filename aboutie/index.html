<p>There's more that can be said about me than what's on the <i>Intro</i> page? Apparently.</p>
<div class="aboutie">
	<p>
		I was born on Decemember 11th, currently reside on planet Earth, and go by the name Deleca or sometimes Ladybird ( hence the site name, badylird ) on the Interwebs. I have an Insignificant life and happiness for a dream. I do have and frequently wear the headphones shown In the site artwork. If you're attentive you'll notice how I capitalize words If they start with an 'I'. I know that Is super weird and It's because something I misheard/misremembered In school years ago stuck with me. It's a habit at this point that I usually prefer for visual reasons.

		My hobbies Include drawing, wiki editing, and trying to pick up other skills. My biggest ambition Is to become a self-sufficient person. There's so many things I see that make me think "I want to do that". I wish to sing, make music, become a better artist, animate, 3d model, program, develop things. It's difficult to describe what I do In my free time, as It completely depends on what I'm currently Indulged In. I'm always brainstorming Ideas that will "never happen", like this site. I have a tendacy to go on and on about things that Intrigue me.

		A Pokémon aficionado and coffee enjoyer, I listen to music like most people. There's other series I enjoy such as Splatoon, Shantae, Touhou, Sims, Persona―but my Interests can also be particular or specific. There are things from Nintendo I like for example, but I'm not the type of person who could call themselves a fan of most games or franchises they produce but It Is fun to watch others play them. I own three 3DSes and Installed custom firmware on two of them. In addition I own a couple Gameboys, Switch, Playstation 5, and previously owned a Wii U, Playstation 3, and Xbox 360.

		I once had a sister and a mother but both have passed away years apart. But I'm still here, pressing on, making a site and finding a purpose. So far, the Idealism of "If nothing else the most I can/should do Is at least bring joy to others' lives" has worked out for me. With the support of a couple people here and there through rough times I'm still around, to do even more ridiculously stupid things here In this cyber space. To tell the tales that couldn't be told. To watch what life still has to unfold.
